ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product`
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>`

=begin
The method `calculate_product` is defined in line one in irb
In line 4, `calculate_product` is called but only passed one argument instead of 2, therefore causing an error.
