Exception handling is the process of handling the possibility of errors raised in a program.
It handles the error by changing the flow of control without exiting the program.

~~Exception handling is the process of managing errors in a manageable and predictable way.~~
~~It solves the issue of the program stopping when encountering an error caused by an unpredictable condition.~~
